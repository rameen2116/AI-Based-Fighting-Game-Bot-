AI-Based Fighting Game Bot:
 Project Overview:
The aim of this project was to develop an AI-powered bot capable of playing the Street 
Fighter II Turbo (U) game in the BizHawk Emulator. The bot uses a machine learning 
model to predict and execute the best fighting moves based on the current game state. 
Unlike rule-based bots, this AI was trained using real gameplay data, ensuring it can adapt 
to various scenarios and fight more effectively.

• Developed an AI-powered bot to play Street Fighter II Turbo (U) using machine learning on real gameplay data.
• Collected and preprocessed game state data including player health, positions, actions, and button presses for model training.
• Implemented a MultiOutput Random Forest Classifier to predict optimal moves with an offensive bias.
• Integrated the trained model into the bot’s decision logic to execute real-time gameplay actions within the BizHawk emulator.
• Enhanced prediction accuracy through hyperparameter tuning and dataset augmentation for aggressive strategies.
• Evaluated performance against CPU opponents and iteratively improved the bot’s adaptability and effectiveness.
